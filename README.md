## ✨ What This Project Does

Most people lose track of money because transactions happen frequently and in small amounts. This project solves that by giving the user:

- A simple interface to record income/expense quickly
- A transaction list to review spending history
- A dashboard to instantly see:
  - Total income
  - Total expense
  - Remaining balance
- Category-wise analysis to understand spending patterns

This application supports **secure authentication**, **protected API routes**, and user-specific data so each user only accesses their own transactions.
